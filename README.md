Module 3 Challenge 

# Description
  - This project consisted of two main components. PyBank and PyPoll.
  
  In the PyBank component, I analyzed the financial records of my organization and recorded key financial insights over this time period.
  This included my companies net profit, the average change in profits per period as well as the biggest profits and losses during this time frame.

  In the PyPoll component, I helped a small town create a more dynamic and modern vote-counting system. 
  This meant writing code to more effectively count the number of votes for each candidate and to declare a winner by popular vote.

# Table of Contents
  - Each main component (PyBank and PyPoll) has their own folder.
    - Each component has three folders
        - analysis, Resources, and a main.py file.
        -  The analysis folder will contain a text file of the results
        -  the Resources folder will containt the data used
        -  The main.py file is where all the code is stored
     

# Credits
  - PyPoll - A complete list of candidates who received votes
    - I used the AskBCS Learning Assistant to receive help for this portion. They gave me the idea to add each candidate into a list.
